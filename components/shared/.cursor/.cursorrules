# AGIVC Logo Component Rules

## Component Location

- File: `components/shared/agivc-logo.tsx`
- This is a reusable logo component used throughout the application

## Usage Guidelines

### Props

- `mode`: Optional prop that can be `"light"`, `"dark"`, or `"auto"` (default: `"auto"`)
  - `"light"`: Forces light logo variant
  - `"dark"`: Forces dark logo variant
  - `"auto"`: Automatically detects theme from page's dark class
- `className`: Optional CSS classes for styling
- `width`: Optional width prop (default: 400)
- `height`: Optional height prop (default: 133)

### Logo Files

- Logo files are located in `/public/logos/`
- Standard logo: `agivc-logo-nov-25-{light|dark}.png`
- Wordmark logo: `agivc-wordmark-nov-25-{light|dark}.png`
- Always use dash-case naming convention for logo files

### Animation Behavior

- The component includes a hover animation that wipes from logo to wordmark
- Animation CSS is defined in `app/globals.css` with class `.agivc-logo-group`
- Animation timing: 0.15s duration with sequential transitions
- On hover: Logo disappears first, then wordmark appears (0.15s delay)
- On hover out: Wordmark disappears first, then logo appears (0.15s delay)
- Wordmark is displayed at 150% scale (`scale-150`)

### Implementation Notes

- Component is client-side only (`"use client"`)
- Uses `MutationObserver` to detect theme changes when `mode="auto"`
- Handles SSR by showing light logo during initial render when `mode="auto"`
- Logo and wordmark images are absolutely positioned for overlay effect

### When to Use

- Use `<AgivcLogo />` in header, footer, or anywhere the AGIVC logo is needed
- Use `mode="light"` for light backgrounds (e.g., header)
- Use `mode="dark"` for dark backgrounds (e.g., footer)
- Use `mode="auto"` when logo should adapt to page theme

### Do Not

- Do not import logo images directly - always use this component
- Do not modify the animation timing without updating both CSS and component
- Do not change logo file paths without updating this component
- Do not remove the `agivc-logo-group` class as it's required for animations
