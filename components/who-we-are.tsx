          We originated from the first and most successful AI Tinkerers chapter in Canada (Ottawa). AIT is an exclusive
          builder-only meetup, founded by Joe Heitzeberg in Seattle in 2023. AIT Ottawa quickly grew from 30 to 1500
          members over 2.5 years.

          Many of our attendees became founders, joining Y Combinator (Outlit W25) and Techstars (Engyne AI). We decided
          to become AGI Ventures Canada to 10x the ecosystem with an official accelerator and venture studio, where we
          build AI projects for F50 and startups alike.
